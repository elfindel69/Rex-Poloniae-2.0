 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
 NEW_BEGINNING_NAME:0 "Europe's new beginning"
 NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "After the Great War which shook Europe and much of the world, some empires have disappeared, others have survived at the cost of a heavy price. Democracy is starting to make its way on the Old Continent and the communist revolution is raging in Russia. Will Europe and the world be at peace for a long time?"
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of peace and recovery. Will it be Peace for Our Time?"
 FRA_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "Despite the devastation of the Great War, France is on the road to recovery thanks to a strong economy base. The treaty of Versailles provides funds and ressources for the reconstruction but its bases are fragile.\n\nWhen the treaty was signed, a French marshal famously remarked that it was not peace, but an armistice of 20 years. We will see if he was right."
 GER_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "A new Germany has risen, after the trumoil of the Great War, a new Kaiser was crowned, but the country economy is destabilized by the restrictions of the Versailles Treaty.\n\nThe military restrictions imposed on Germany by the Versailles Treaty are plundering the army. Unrest may be on the horizon."
 ITA_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "With the rise of Monarchism, Italy has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of stablilizing the new colonial Empire, but the King Victor Emmanuel's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been Italy's destiny, and the Vittoria mutilata of the Versailles Treaty is still fresh. When the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
 JAP_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Soviet Union is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
 USA_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the war, hoping to enjoy a period of economic prosperity in the coming Twenties.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but it was already bypassed. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:1 "Poland has remained free and independent despite conflicts and crises. But its position is not an easy one.\n\nCivil war is raging in Russia and the communist threat may soon come to Poland.\n\n The fierce Germany ruminates in the shadows after the terrible blow of the Great War. The country is at a crossroads."
 CAN_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow, the German are kept at bay, but they may come back. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nWith Japan looking to expand in Asia and the Pacific, the people of New Zealand looks anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war being far away, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 CZE_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although with the civil war in Russia the political landscape of Europe may rapidly change."
 HUN_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nNow that peace is here, some think that time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchionist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans, hoping to maintain peace in this fragile region. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe is stabilizing, Romania is at crossroads."
 YUG_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922.Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence. People hope that these new alliances will stand the test of time."
 CHI_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "Following the revolution that deposed the last of the Qing Emperors, the young Chinese Republic is emerging. Peace is fragile and some leaders are plotting in the dark to take power. Just beyond the borders, the Japanese have created a puppet government under the last Chinese Emperor and will try to reunite the country under his rule.\n\nWith many enemies threatening it, the government of Chiang Kai-Shek will have to make hard choices if it wants to survive and rule supreme in China."
 PRC_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "The young communist party has managed to make a base deep in the mountains. Ressources and people are few.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will rise, until final victory is achieved."
 MAN_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1920 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."
 WARLORDS_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government. \n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice: Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists? Either option promises a chance for a seat at the table, but there is a third possibility - to take China all for themselves."
 MEXICO_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "Mexico faced a decade of civil wars after the overthrow of the tyrant Porfirio Díaz. Centralizers fought regionalists, peasants and socialists rallied against hacienda landlords, and battles over the role of state versus religion came out of the annals of the Enlightenment to terrorize Mexico.\n\nThe secularist government insists that it won these battles, but it is seated on a throne of debris. After Mexico is rebuilt, perhaps a different victor will have emerged."
 NETHERLANDS_NEW_BEGINNING_DESC:0 "The Dutch government eyes the fragile peace with concern. Between an ailing economy, a powerful pacifist movement, and a firm belief in neutrality to the point of driving potential allies away, they are unable to properly prepare their defenses.\n\nAt the same time, the importance of the Netherlands as a gateway of trade into the continent means that both the British and the Germans desire Dutch 'cooperation' to thwart the other, and may take rejection as a reason for hostility. Perhaps withdrawal to the colonies is the only possible means to resist such an invasion..."
