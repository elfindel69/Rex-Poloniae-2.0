Many countries have built railway guns, but the best known are the large Krupp-built pieces used by Germany in World War I and World War II. Railway guns have been rendered obsolete by advances in technology. Their large size and limited mobility make them vulnerable to attack, and similar payloads can be delivered by aircraft, rocket, or missile"
