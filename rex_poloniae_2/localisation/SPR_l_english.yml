It further dropped when the king authorized the formation of a military dictatorship under general Miguel Primo de Rivera, ignoring his own Constitution. This led to a hatred of the king among the majority of the Spanish society. As a result, in 1931, two years after the end of the dictatorship, the Second Republic was proclaimed and the king Alfonso XII fled the country. \n\nThe first republican government was led by Manuel Azaña and it was a coalition between republicans, liberals and socialists. It passed important reforms ( Agrarian, Military and Education ) which angered the right and, due to their slow application, the left. Disputes between socialists and republicans led to the breakup of the government and the right-wing CEDA victory in the 1933 election. \n\nThe president Alcalá-Zamora, afraid of the CEDA, appointed the liberal Alejandro Lerroux head of government, although he had to admit some CEDA misters. This provoked a socialist revolution in 1934 that was put down by the army. After one year of relative stability, Lerroux resigned due to a corruption scandal. Alcalá-Zamora refused to allow a CEDA government and disbanded the parliament, calling for new elections in february of 1936. In the meanwhile, a provisional government run by the liberal veteran Manuel Portela, friend of Zamora, ran the country."
